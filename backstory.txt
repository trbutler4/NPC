8,000 bags containing magical items (called loot) were scattered across the Lootverse. The bags were quickly picked up by Adventurers.

Since that day, Adventurers have wandered the realms, asking questions about who they are and what their purpose is. But finding meaning is hard when you don’t know your true history. There are whispers, of course. Little clues. Myths of long wars and dragons and demons. But nothing concrete, nothing to build a future on top of.

Then, one wandering tribe of Adventurers came across a strange pyramid, with marble steps reaching way up high above the mist and shadow of the realms. The marble steps were brighter than anything they’d ever seen. The clouds so close you could touch them with your hands.

At the top of the steps was a gateway.

One by one, they stepped through. One by one, they arrived in a different time and place. 

They arrived in a floating city.

They started exploring. They found the city empty, abandoned. From a distance it looked so beautiful. Up close, the city was falling apart. The buildings and streets were in disrepair.

The Adventurers decided to stay here, decided to rebuild, to bring Divine City back to life. They discovered magical abilities, artifacts, pieces of history – answers to the questions they’ve been asking. They started to find meaning. They started to create meaning, together.
